				<p>You don’t need a special reason to give blood; you just need your own reason. Some of us give blood because we were asked by a friend. Some know that a family member or a friend might need blood some day. Some believe it is the right thing we do.</p>
				<p>The number one reason donors say they give blood is because they “want to help others.” (I donate because I was one of these people that needed help in the summer of 2004.)</p>
				<p>Whatever your reason, the need is constant and your contribution is important for a healthy and reliable blood supply. And you’ll feel good knowing you’ve helped change a life.</p>
